To install this service, you will need to have the following python packages installed:

cherrypy
psycopg2
sqlalchemy
werkzeug

Depending on your os version you can install them with the system package manager, or you
may have to install them manually.

Ubuntu 11.10
============

On Ubuntu you can install these with the following command:

   sudo apt-get install python-cherrypy3 python-psycopg2 python-sqlalchemy python-werkzeug


Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS
==================

On Ubuntu LTS you will have to install a newer sqlalchemy with pip, but first install the
the other required packages:

   sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv python-cherrypy3 python-werkzeug python-psycopg2

Create the virtualenv:

   virtualenv ~/virtualenv

Install the requirements in the virtualenv:

   ~/virtualenv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt


Running the server
==================

CherryPy is used as the WSGI server. To deploy, simply copy coverart_redirect.conf.dist
to coverart_redirect.conf, edit the settings to point to a MusicBrainz postgres install
and where to listen for connections.

Then run coverart_redirect_server.py to run the service. All logging goes to stdout,
including stacktraces, so its suitable for running inside of daemontools.

If you've installed some of the required packages with virtualenv, run the server
using python from the virtualenv directory:

    ~/virtualenv/bin/python coverart_redirect_server.py
