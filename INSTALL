To install this service, you will need to have the following python packages installed:

cherrypy
psycopg2
sqlalchemy
werkzeug

On Ubuntu you can install these with the following command:

   sudo apt-get install python-cherrypy3 python-psycopg2 python-sqlalchemy python-werkzeug

CherryPy is used as the WSGI server. To deploy, simply copy coverart_redirect.conf.dist
to coverart_redirect.conf, edit the settings to point to a MusicBrainz postgres install
and where to listen for connections.

Then run coverart_redirect_server.py to run the service. All logging goes to stdout,
including stacktraces, so its suitable for running inside of daemontools.
